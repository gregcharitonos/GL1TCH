# GL1TCH
An experiment in Science Communication using CTFs

This repository serves as a backup of the original project, and also to showcase this project and its code

## How It Works
Posters placed around campus contain unique QR Codes that (originally) point to a digital variant of the physical poster.

During the event, participants sign up to a "social network", wherein they can update their "about" page, and private message other users.

At the same time, participants are given a second link, to their "Toolbox". This toolbox is to contain a number of exploits and hacker subculture artifacts. These can be gathered by participants by scanning each of the QR Codes found on the posters around campus. Participants are incentivised to actively seek out these codes to discover the various toolbox hacks, and hack their friends and colleagues for fun and fame.
