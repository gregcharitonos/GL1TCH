    This <b>XSS</b> exploit, like others of its kind before, wreaks total havoc on a website. This is an end-game hack. This script <b>self-replicates</b>, causing anyone who loads it up to directly copy it to their bio, thus infecting anyone who views it. The result? A contagious web-based virus.
  </p>
  <p><b>Thought:</b>The bio is the vector for spreading this hack, so messages aren't the only vulnerable part of the app. What else might be vulnerable?</p>
